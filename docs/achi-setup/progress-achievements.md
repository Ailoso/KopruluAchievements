## What are They?

Progress Achievements are Achievements that Contain Progress bars, they are useful when for example tracking total damage across games or tracking locally without saving to banks if a player has for example killed a number of enemies during a mission.

They can also combine with series to track a much larger count, though that feature is adressed further in the Series Section along with others.

## Adding a Progress Achievement

These require the same basic values as a Basic Achievement only needing the `Required Count` value to be set. 

Once done a progess bar will be displayed in the Expanded Content when clicking an achievement, progress is displayed automatically
