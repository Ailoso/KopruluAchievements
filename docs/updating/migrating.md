## Installing the New Version

Now place the new version of the Mod where the old one was, rename it to the old version's name if needed.

Open the mod and we'll begin by setting the Creator variables, for reference check the Configuration page

Replace the `KL_DevPanels.SC2Layout` file we saved from earlier


`If User Data was in the Mod:` Replace the `UserData.xml` file we saved from earlier

## Testing

Wrapping up installation simply launch your map and see if your Achievements show up as well as your customized Tree View Tabs otherwise contact `Chonky Kat#8186` at Discord
