## Add the Extension to Your Map/Mod

To facilitate future updates and version migration any data is not added in the mod, instead it is added to your map or core Mod, some slight modification is required.

To begin [Download](https://github.com/Ailoso/KopruluAchievements) the latest release of the Libraries and extract it

Place the folder `KopruluAchievements.SC2Mod` in the Starcraft 2 Installation Folder > Mods, you may rename the mod if you need making sure to keep the extension.

Open your Core Mod file or your Map file, Navigate to the top left menu > File > Dependencies and Add the Koprulu Achievements modfile.

Now you've finished adding the mod to your Map/Mod follow the [Configuration](/kopruluAchievements/docs/setup/configuration/) step next.
